- **Bookings Page**: In the bookings page there will be the bookings that users made to book a room, or several rooms, with important data like check in and check out dates. Click on any booking to see more details about it.
- **Rooms Page**: Display all the rooms availables and booked too. Enter any room to see some pics inside and check important info about it
